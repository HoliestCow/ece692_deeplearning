                <h3>Urban Radiological Search Data Competition</h3>
                <p>Welcome to the Modeling Urban Search Experiments Data Competition at <a href="https://datacompetitions.lbl.gov/">datacompetitions.lbl.gov</a>!
 Our goals as competition hosts are to spur new, innovative thinking in 
radiation detection algorithms, to engage a broader community in 
nonproliferation problems, and to demonstrate the use of a competition 
framework to explore mobile searches for non-natural radiation sources 
in urban environments.</p>
                <p>For this competition, we have used radiation 
transport simulations to create thousands of data sets resembling 
typical radiological search data collected on urban streets in a 
mid-sized U.S. city. Each data set – a run – simulates the detection 
events received by a standard thallium-doped sodium iodide – NaI(Tl) – 
detector, specifically a 2”×4”×16” NaI(Tl) detector, driving along 
several city street blocks in a search vehicle. All of the runs contain 
data on radiation-detector interaction events from the natural 
background sources (roadway, sidewalks, and buildings), and some of the 
runs also contain data arising from non-natural extraneous radiation 
sources. </p>
                <p>The event data created for this competition is 
derived from a simplified radiation transport model – a street without 
parked cars, pedestrians, or other ‘clutter’, a constant search vehicle 
speed with no stoplights, and no vehicles surrounding the search 
vehicle. In fact, the search vehicle itself is not even in the model – 
the detector is moving down the street by itself, 1 meter off the 
ground. This simple model provides a starting point for comparing 
detection algorithms at their most basic level.</p>
                <p>For each run in the test set, you’ll use your 
detection algorithm on the event data to determine (1) whether there is a
 non-natural extraneous source along the path (the detection component),
 and if so, (2) what type of source it is (identification) and (3) at 
what point the detector was closest to it during the run (location — 
which in this competition will be reported in seconds from the start of 
the run).</p>
                <p>This effort is supported by the Enabling Capabilities
 for Nonproliferation and Arms Control (EC) Program Area of the Office 
of Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation Research and Development (DNN 
R&amp;D), part of the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), a
 semi-autonomous agency within the US Department of Energy. The DNN 
R&amp;D office funds basic research to support other programs within the
 NNSA and other government agencies that have missions involving 
radiation detection.</p>
               <h4>How it Works</h4>
               <p>The competition will run from January 8 to April 9, 
2018. Within that window, each team can submit its answers for the runs 
in the <a href="https://datacompetitions.lbl.gov/competition/1/download/">test set</a>.
  Competitors may form their own autonomous teams or be part of a larger
 team, in which the team’s best scores are used.  This site is solely 
for government-sponsored users, whereas ‘unfunded’ competitors are 
encouraged to compete via https://www.kaggle.com/.  Government-sponsored
 users (e.g., national laboratory employees or other researchers 
receiving US government sponsorship) may request an account <a href="https://datacompetitions.lbl.gov/register/">here</a>,
 after the account has been approved or during registration, users may 
request to join an existing team within any active competition (for now,
 that’s just the MUSE Pilot Competition).  Approved users may also 
request to create their own team.  Requests to join new teams or to 
create a new team require approval by site administrators or the 
existing team’s point of contact.  Upon creation of a team, submitted 
answers will show up on the public leaderboard. </p>
<p>We allow up to 1000 submissions per team during the competition, each
 of which will be scored. Each team’s best score will be reported on the
 public <a href="https://datacompetitions.lbl.gov/competition/1/leaderboard/"> leaderboard</a>. The public <a href="https://datacompetitions.lbl.gov/competition/1/leaderboard/"> leaderboard</a> rankings will be based on your answers to approximately 43% of the test set runs. </p>
<p>The final rankings will be based on the remaining 57% of runs and so 
may be different from what the public leaderboard shows. The top three 
teams in the final rankings will be recognized at an upcoming DNN 
R&amp;D review meeting.</p>
