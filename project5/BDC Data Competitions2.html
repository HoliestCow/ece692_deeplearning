<h4><strong>Data Description</strong></h4>
<p>For the competition we have generated data from thousands of runs 
that mimic what would be acquired by a 2”×4”×16” NaI(Tl) detector moving
 down a simplified street in a mid-sized U.S. city. Each run has been 
designed so that no source is present within the first 30 seconds of 
measurements.</p>
<p>In a real urban search scenario, you would be able to see the general layout of the street as the detector moves along. <img src="BDC%20Data%20Competitions2_files/DataAndDetailsImage.png" height="303" align="right" width="297">
 A notional diagram is shown at the right, though the exact street 
geometry for each run will be different (and unspecified). Buildings 
made of different materials (red, beige, and dark gray) occupy most of 
the space along the main street, with a few asphalt parking areas 
(white), and grass-covered park areas (green). The main street (also 
white) has four travel lanes, two in each direction, and several cross 
streets. Travel lanes are each ten feet wide and there is at least 10 
feet of sidewalk (gray) between the outer travel lane and the building 
facades. Detector paths are all within one of the four main traffic 
lanes – with no lane switching and no turning onto the cross streets.</p>
<p>The set of data for a given run mimics what a detector would see in 
real-time: a list of pairs, each comprising the time at which a gamma 
ray interacted within the radiation detector and the corresponding 
energy the gamma ray deposited in the detector. Times are in 
microseconds (µsec, millionths of a second) since the last event, and 
the deposited energy is in units of kilo-electronvolts (keV). The time 
recorded for the first event in each run will be zero. Algorithms can 
bin the data into any time and energy structure you choose.</p> 
<p>For each run, several characteristics are fixed a priori:
</p><ul>
<li>The lane and direction of travel.</li>
<li>The speed of travel, a constant between 1 and 13.4 m/s.</li>
<li>The street geometry (e.g., what buildings are present where).</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p>If a source is present, the following characteristics are also fixed:
</p><ul>
<li>The type of source (see below for the list of types and their SourceID labels).</li>
<li>The strength of the source.</li>
<li>Whether the source is shielded.</li>
<li>The location of the source along the street.</li></ul>
<p>Although the source characteristics will not be revealed in the test 
data set, they do impact the data recorded in each file. For instance, 
fewer source-induced events will be recorded if the detector is moving 
at a faster speed, and more events will be recorded if the source has a 
higher strength.</p>

<h4><strong>Source Types</strong></h4>
<p>If a source is present in a run, it will be one of six types:</p>
   <table align="center">
   <thead>
     <tr>
       <th align="left" width="30%">SourceID</th>
       <th align="right" width="70%">Source Type</th>
     </tr>
   </thead>
   <tbody>
       <tr>
         <td>1</td>
         <td>HEU: Highly enriched uranium</td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
         <td>2</td>
         <td>WGPu: Weapons grade plutonium</td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
         <td>3</td>
         <td><sup>131</sup>I: Iodine, a medical isotope</td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
         <td>4</td>
         <td><sup>60</sup>Co: Cobalt, an industrial isotope</td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
         <td>5</td>
         <td><sup>99m</sup>Tc: Technetium, a medical isotope</td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
         <td>6</td>
         <td>A combination of <sup>99m</sup>Tc and HEU</td>
       </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>
<p></p>
<p>If no source is present, the SourceID field should be entered as 0. 
For all runs, there will be no source within the first 30 seconds of 
measurements. That is, you’re guaranteed at least 30 seconds of 
background-only measurements in each run.</p>

<p>Energy spectra for each source type are shown below for a significant quantity <sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>
 of source types 1 and 2 and 1 microcurie (μCi) for source types 3-5. In
 each figure, the solid curve shows the unshielded spectrum and the 
dashed curve, the spectrum with 1 cm of lead shielding. The plots show 
sources 1 meter away from the center of the detector in a vacuum.</p>

<h4><strong>File Formats</strong></h4>
<p>Files for this competition are standard ASCII and comma delimited 
(CSV format). They include run files that contain the radiation 
detection event data for each run and answer files that contain the 
source type and source time for all the runs in either the training or 
the test set.</p>
<h5>Run Files</h5>
<p>The events for each run (one instance of a detector traveling down a 
street) is contained in a run file named with a unique run ID number. 
Each run file contains a list of radiation detection events, one event 
per row. Each row gives the time in microseconds since the previous 
recorded event and the deposited energies of this event in keV. For the 
first event in each run file, the time since the last event is recorded 
as 0.</p>
<p>Example Run File (excerpt from Training File 100001.csv):</p>
<p><font face="Courier">0,69.0 <br>
985,154.7 <br>
757,55.5 <br>
908,1106.9 <br>
1105,356.1 <br>
391,116.9 <br>
…</font>
</p>
<p>In this example, the first row records the first event, which had a 
deposited energy of 69 keV. The second row describes the 2nd event, 
which  occurred 985 µsec after the first with a deposited energy of 
154.7 keV. The third row records an event that occurred 757 µsec after 
the second event (985 +757 = 1742 µsec since the beginning of the run) 
with a deposited energy of 55.5 keV.  The event descriptions continue, 
row-by-row until the end of the run.</p>

<h5>Answers Files</h5>
<p>For the training set, the answers file contains the correct answer 
for each run file in CSV format. Each row of the training set answers 
file gives an identifier for the run (RunID), an identifier for the 
source type (SourceID), and the time in seconds (reported to the nearest
 1/100 of a second) at which the detector was closest to the source 
(SourceTime), sometimes referred to as the time of closest approach. For
 runs without an extraneous source (background only), SourceID and 
SourceTime are both 0.</p>
<p>Example Training Set Answers File:</p>
<p><font face="Courier">RunID,SourceID,SourceTime <br>
100001,0,0.00, <br>
100002,0,0.00, <br>
100003,0,0.00, <br>
100004,1,65.58, <br>
100005,0,0.00, <br>
100006,6,36.19, <br>
100007,1,44.10, … <br>
…</font></p>
<p>In the example training file, the first row is for run number 100001,
 which, like runs 100002 and 100003, had no extraneous source present (0
 for SourceID and 0 for SourceTime), while the fourth row (after the 
header) is for run number 100004, which had source 1 (HEU) present at a 
location that was nearest the detector 65.58 seconds after the start of 
that run.</p>
<p>The format for the test set answers file is the same as for the 
training set answers file, except that the user may optionally add ASCII
 text comments into a fourth column that the competition hosts will be 
able to see. You will fill in the SourceID and SourceTime fields of the 
answers file for each run in the test set and <a href="https://datacompetitions.lbl.gov/competition/1/upload">submit the entire file for scoring</a></p>
